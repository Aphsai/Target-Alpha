                        <img src="img/1.6.2_senior_management_team_david_yuen.png"/>
                        <p><b> Tell us a bit about your career escalation and how you ended up as CPPIB’s Head of Fundamental Investing? </b></p>
                        <p> I spent close to 15 years at the asset manager, Bernstein, in NYC. Prior to that I spent a decade in management consultant and corporate executive. At Bernstein I followed consumer companies and was the consumer lead. I went on to co-lead Bernstein's Emerging Markets fund from 2002-2007, then as acted as the Director of Research for US large cap, which was a bursting flagship product (150B in peak assets). I later become Co-CIO for a bit. In 2012 I got call about an opportunity to go to CPPIB. CPPIB had just split their fundamental and quantitate methods and they needed someone to head the fundamental area. When I joined it was a relatively small area. I was asked to come in and craft a strategy to grow the investments, and to globalize it. This fund employs a long-short strategy, has $6.5B invested in it, and generated a cumulated alpha of 12% since 2012. </p>
                        <p><b> Why switch to the investment business? </b></p>
                        <p> After consulting I was moving more into an operation role which I wasn’t ready for at the time. I also missed intellectual aspect of businesses analytics. I actually got into investment management by accident. I was looking to get into private equity (his client was a PE firm). By accident I had a conversation with Sanford Bernstein and went from there. </p>
                        <p><b> What are the primary metrics you use to value a business? </b></p>
                        <p> We don’t look at ourselves as a value or growth investor. We just look for price inefficiencies. Say for some reason the business is underperforming and we think it will turn - those are Value plays we like. In general, I like low price to book, or low price cash flow to earnings. On the opposite end of spectrum there’s under appreciated growth companies. </p>
                        <p><b> How do you determine the economic moat a business operates in? Is it something you can quantify? </b></p>
                        <p> We definitely look for it. We generally look for the following: a history of stability of market share, a market share gainer, and our own personal understanding of the competitive structure of the industry. </p>
                        <p><b> Warren Buffett once said that “I could make you 50% a year on a million bucks” why is this true? </b></p>
                        <p> I’m not sure the context of that. It’s a bold statement. I interpret it as there are probably more mispriced opportunities when you have to put less money to work. As you put more and more money to work, amount of mispriced opportunities is finite. If I have a large fund and have to buy 1,000 mispriced opportunities, there are fewer good ones to choose from. The great thing about our position is that due to global markets, long-short equity is not capacity constrained. </p>
                        <p><b> What's your take on companies like Wealthsimple and similar FinTech startups that are trying to make a dent in the financial services industry? </b></p>
                        <p> Financial services is definitely something that will go through structural change (regulatory environment will change). Change in position of large financial institutions. Technology has changed how transactions have taken place. We are heavily engaged in research of companies that will play a role in the future. Most of the change will be a function of how transactions are conducted (anything from blockchains to interchange transactions). </p>
                        <p><b> What advice would you give to a student? </b></p>
                        <p> If someone has an ambition to consider financial services as a career, try to intern at an organization like CPPIB where there's diversity of investment strategy, enabling you to learn about many different asset classes, and from different investors in the business. For a young person, the variety is great. Only a handful of institutions that can do this. </p>
