                        <p><b> Tell us a bit about your career escalation and how you ended up as Mackenzie’s CEO </b></p>
                        <p> I came from Regina to Queen’s University to study Commerce. I was lucky to receive a scholarship and have a father who could support my education. When I got there I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do, but spent a lot of time exploring. Being around all the really smart/ambitious people and professors at Queen’s helped me a lot. I then went to Merrill Lynch and rotated through their divisions. From there I just kept trying to move upwards and exceed people’s expectations. </p>
                        <p><b> What are the initial filters that Mackenzie uses when grading a potential investment? </b></p>
                        <p> We deploy two big models when analyzing an investment. One is our integrated research division. Here we all share information across a variety of sectors and topics and try to find insights through all of these. Next, is our specific teams. We have 11 teams in total, each with their own industry focus. Teams can be as small as 2-3 people and as large as 17 people.  </p>
                        <p><b> There’s a lot of political unrest around the world. How do you factor this into your investment selection? </b></p>
                        <p> We have a committee that has a macro outlook to determine things like country risk. This primarily impacts things such as our balanced funds. Different funds have different styles for looking at the world – depending on where the fund is invested in and its time horizon. </p>
                        <p><b> One thing I want to do was congratulate you guys on your new identity. It looks great! There’s a lot of mention of innovation, and I was wondering how Mackenzie has become a more innovative organization? </b></p>
                        <p> We have to have a competitive edge to thrive. You must look at what your competitive advantage is and ensure that it can’t easily be replicated. We wanted to ensure that we were doing keeping up to speed on new trends and technology in order to stay the best. </p>
                        <p><b> What’s your take on companies like Wealthsimple and similar FinTech startups that are trying to make a dent in the financial services industry? </b></p>
                        <p> I believe that innovation is a great thing. It keeps everyone competitive and making better options for the customer. We invested in Wealthsimple and think it is a great platform. A service like that is great for millennial and is able to push out new interactions everyday, whereas they can only do maybe one a year. A lot of things get pushed across my desk one-day stating that its going to be the next big thing that’s going to change our industry, and then the next day get another report saying that it won’t. Some things will be disruptive and some will be complimentary. But a lot of this needs time to adapt. </p>
                        <p><b> How do you see developments in artificial intelligence and digital currencies changing the investing arena? </b></p>
                        <p> I don’t see it all going one way. When you pool investors together it always makes for good prices. Mackenzie uses a lot of social media and that will only get accelerated; some of this technology will be disruptive and some will only be complimentary to what is already being used. </p>
                        <p><b> What advice would you give to current students? </b></p>
                        <p> At school you pay to learn, but in the workforce you can get paid to learn. You should focus on optimizing your learning wherever you go. Choose what you want to learn and go to a firm that will give you that. Rotation programs are great. In investments, you can spend some time working in a firm’s investment teams. Here you’ll find what you’re good at and passionate about. It’ll be stressful so you have to love it. I always say that working at Merrill Lynch was my MBA. I was able to learn so much and advance my career in so many ways. As a final note, always remember to be able to adapt, and stay curious. </p>
